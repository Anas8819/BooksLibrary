  The "Book Library" SPA application is a simple web application that allows users to create and view a list of books. You can add a book by clicking the "Add Book" button and providing appropriate detials. Once a book is added, it is displayed in a list along with all the other books that have been added.

  Users can quickly and easily add new books to the library, and view all the books that have been added. This app can be useful for personal book collections or for small organizations that need to manage a list of books.
